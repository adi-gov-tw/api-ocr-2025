# Contribute to the ASR Project

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code contributions are not the only way to help the community‚Äîanswering questions, helping others, and improving documentation are also highly valuable ways to contribute.

If you wish, you can also help us by promoting the project! Mention this project in blog posts about your amazing work using it, share your experiences on social media whenever the project helps you, or simply give this repository a ‚≠êÔ∏è to show your appreciation.

Whatever way you choose to contribute, please make sure to follow and respect our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

You can contribute to the ASR project in several ways:

- Fix issues in the existing code
- Submit issues related to bugs or feature requests
- Implement new features or models
- Contribute to examples or documentation

If you are not sure where to start, our issue tracker has a special **Good First Issue** label, which provides a list of open issues suitable for beginners to help you get started with open source contributions. The best way is to open a Pull Request and link it to the issue you want to address. We prioritize open PRs because we can easily track progress, and if a contributor doesn't have time to continue, others can take over the PR.

> All contributions are equally important to the community. ü•∞
